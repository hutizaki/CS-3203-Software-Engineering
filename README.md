## How to Make Changes to the Project

### Step One: Create a New Branch

1. **MAKE SURE YOU ARE ON (MAIN)** - Ensure you're on the main branch before creating a new branch.

2. **Create a new branch** using the following naming convention:
   - Format: `{your-name}/{thing-or-change-you-plan-on-working-on}`
   - Example: `john/feature-user-authentication` or `jane/bugfix-login-error`

3. **Command to create and switch to the new branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b 'branch name'
   ```
